# Open Ridge

Open Ridge is a small fun project written mostly in C++.  
The goal is to create a fully working racing game using Visual Studio.  
It is currently underwhelming but i plan to develop my skills through this.

This project is open source and will be developed openly here on GitHub.  
Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## How to build  
Open the solution in Visual Studio and build the project.
